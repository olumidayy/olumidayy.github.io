          Time Magazine called Mrs. Kingsbury the queen of Christian fiction.
          That title does seem to be well earned. She is a #1 New York Times
          bestselling novelist who has written or coauthored close to 100 novels
          and short stories. There are more than twenty-five million copies of
          her books in print. Many of her stories have been, or are in the
          process of being, made into movies. There is also a TV series under
          development with Roma Downey and Light Workers Media based on her
          popular Baxter Family books. In addition to all of that, Liberty
          University has established the Karen Kingsbury Center for Writing at
          which she serves as an adjunct professor. She also hosts her own radio
          program called appropriately enough, The Karen Kingsbury Show. As a
          public speaker she connects with more than 100,000 women at various
          events each year.

          So how did she get started on her journey to become one of the most
          well-loved Christian authors of our day? If your picturing a little
          girl with a Bible in her hand and Jesus in her heart you would be
          wrong. She did have a love of books at an early age. As a child her
          family moved a lot. While she would have to leave friends behind she
          would forever be connected to the stories she read. She had a
          particular fondness for the works of Dr. Seuss. Mrs. Kingsbury
          received a journalism degree from Cal State University Northridge.
          Following this she worked at the Los Angeles Times as a sports
          reporter. Later she would also write about crime.

          In 1991 Mrs. Kingsbury had her first book published. Missy’s Murder
          was a true crime story based on a murder that she covered as a
          reporter. She authored three other true crime books before trying her
          hand at a novel. She had trouble finding a publisher for Where
          Yesterday Lives. Mrs. Kingsbury received thirty rejection letters
          before Multnomah Publishers decided to give her a try. In an interview
          with CBN she explains why Christian fiction has become so popular over
          the last few years. “Secular writers can tell a story about the
          physical, the emotional, and the intellectual parts of a character.
          But no matter how well they tell the story, they miss a facet that is
          innately part of all of us – the spiritual. As a Christian fiction
          writer, I can tell a story about the complete person, the whole
          character. I think this resonates with readers, and touches them in
          the deepest parts of their hearts and souls.” In the same interview
          she told about her process for writing.
          <i
            >“I write one novel at a time, but I can research multiple titles at
            once. I take about six to eight weeks to write a novel, once the
            research is finished.”</i

          Personally, I have read 90% of all her books and I know for a surety
          that Karen Kingsbury is the Author I hope to be. She inspires me not
          only to write but to understand the gift of family, love and
          friendship which has helped me in my relationships today. The Baxter
          Family and Bailey Flanigan series are my favorite. Karen Kingsbury has
          had a remarkable life and an extraordinary career. She has entertained
          and encouraged countless readers, primarily women. Along the way she
          has inspired a few of us men as well. Thank you, Karen for the many
          volumes of life-changing fiction. Long live the queen!
